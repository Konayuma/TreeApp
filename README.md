Tree Visualization Tool

This Tree Visualization Tool is designed to make the learning process more intuitive by allowing users to create, traverse, and analyze binary trees with an easy-to-use interface. Whether you're a student, educator, or developer, this tool is a powerful resource for visualizing and understanding tree data structures.

Features

- Node Management: Easily add and delete nodes with automatic tree balancing.
- Traversal Algorithms: Visualize tree traversals using Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order methods.
- Subtree Analysis: Analyze subtrees for total nodes, leaf nodes, and depth.
- Step-by-Step Traversal: Watch the traversal process unfold node by node.
- Tree Persistence: Save and load trees for future reference.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional for those who want to modify the tool)

Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    git clone https://github.com/Konayuma/TreeApp.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
    cd TreeApp
  
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the tool.

Usage

1. Add Nodes: Enter a label and value for each node, then click "Add Node" to include it in the tree.
2. Delete Nodes: Select a node by clicking on it in the tree, then click "Delete Node" to remove it.
3. Traversal: Choose a traversal method (Pre-order, In-order, or Post-order) from the dropdown menu, then click "Traverse Tree" to see the result. Use "Step-by-Step Traversal" to visualize the process one step at a time.
4. Subtree Analysis: Select a node, then click "Analyze Subtree" to view details about its structure.
5. Save and Load Trees: Use the sidebar to save the current tree or load a previously saved tree.

Customization

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs. The primary files you'll be working with are:

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet for UI elements
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for tree operations and visualization
